# MVA Machine Learning for Time Series Project
Project realised for the MVA course "Machine Learning for Time Series" supervised by Laurent Oudre and Charles Truong. Project is based on [**"Soft-DTW: a Differentiable Loss Function for Time-Series"**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01541.pdf). 

## Report
Report with our contributions [here](https://github.com/RomanPlaud/TimeSeries-Project/blob/master/Time_series_report.pdf).

## Contributions
Our work focuses on reproducing the performances of the paper on specific datasets 50words for classification and ECG5000 for time series prediction.

## Code
We were asked to provide an notebook which can be found [here](https://github.com/RomanPlaud/TimeSeries-Project/blob/master/notebook.ipynb).
Our implementation partly relies on [https://github.com/google-research/soft-dtw-divergences](https://github.com/google-research/soft-dtw-divergences)
